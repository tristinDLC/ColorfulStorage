# Colorful Storage for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

>Note: This is an incomplete widget and is currently a work in progress. Any downloaded files should be checked for accuracy before running. All readme content is written as though this is a finished work. This repo is currently used as a learning tool for myself and embodies the direction and final state I hope to see.

This is a disk usage widget for [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/). This widget is designed to go along with [ubersicht-memory-bar](https://github.com/cobyism/ubersicht-memory-bar) and based off of [DiskUsage-Bar-Widget](https://github.com/dinever/DiskUsage-Bar-Widget), modified to further display exactly _which_ files are taking up all your space. Just like the colors in "About this Mac," each color corresponds to each type of file:

* Audio
* Movies
* Photos
* Apps
* Other

Running Colorful Storage will help you focus in on which types of files are taking up the most space with just a quick glance of your desktop.
